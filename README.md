# XtremeAutoClicker
This wasn't intended as much, but so far, it would be the best autoclicker I've seen.
One problem so far is it requires you have at least 8 cores (Fixed in v0.2), otherwise it will crash,
so don't try using this unless you meet those requirements.

# Usage
This doesn't need much of any explanation

# Building
Requirements:
- Make
- GCC

To build it, just run
```
make
```

You can then run your build with
```
make run
```

Or you can do debugging by running
```
make DEBUG=1
```

# Plans
Not much for plans are availible, but I do have some

- Closing into the background while not getting the CPS
- Replacing the starting and stopping messages with notifications
